#Looking For Pull Requests

The site where you can find possible projects to contribute to, or even publish your own projects and let others find it and help you!.

##Using LFPR

Using the site is dead simple, if you're just browsing, click on the "Find projects" button on the home page, and you'll be redirected to the main list of published projects. If you're interested in a particular programming language you can filter by it.

If you're looking to publish your project and let others find it, just click on the "Publish your project" button on the main page. You'll be redirected to a page, where you'll be invited to enter the project's URL (only works for projects hosted on Github) and after clicking on the "Query" button, all relevant information will be pulled using Github's API. Just click on "Send info" after that, and you'll be all set.

##What's inside it?

Apart from listing repos, LFPR is daily pulling statistics of those projecs from GitHub, trying to display in a graphical manner, how "alive" that project is, because, lets be honest, if you're going to spend your time contributing to someone else's project, you want to make sure that, at least, it's still under development, otherwise, you'll probably sending pull requests that will never be answered.

##Contributing to the project.

This project has a lot more features coming, specially related to project and user statistics, so if you feel like contributing, just go the it's repo, create a ticket and we'll go from there :)
